Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


iverse, we can calculate the number of seashells each person found and then determine how many Leigh has. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Total seashells Mimi picked up:** 2 dozen seashells.
   - Since a dozen is 12, 2 dozen = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) seashells.

2. **Kyle found twice as many seashells as Mimi:**
   - Therefore, Kyle found \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) seashells.

3. **Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found:**
   - One-third of 48 seashells = \( \frac{48}{3} = 16 \) seashells.

Thus, Leigh had 16 seashells. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Ezekiel hikes as a hobby. This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Ezekiel hiked in the first two days.
2. Subtract this distance from the total distance of the hike to find out how much he has left to hike on the third day.

First, let's calculate the distance Ezekiel hiked in the first two days:
- On the first day, he hiked 10 kilometers.
- On the second day, he hiked half the full hike distance, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) kilometers.

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance hiked in the first two days:
\[ 10 + 25 = 35 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall hike distance to find out how many kilometers he has left to hike on the third day:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ kilometers} \]

Therefore, the number of kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day is \(\boxed{15}\).

Pauly is making omelets for his family. There are three dozen eggs, and he plans to use them all. Each omelet requires 4 eggs. Including himself, there are 3 people. How many omelets does each person get? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many omelets each person gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs available.
2. Determine the number of eggs per person.
3. Calculate the number of omelets per person.

First, let's calculate the total number of eggs:
- Pauly has a family of 4 people (including himself).
- He needs 4 eggs per omelet.
- The total number of eggs is \(4 \text{ people} \times 4 \text{ eggs/person} = 16 \text{ eggs}\).

Next, we determine how many omelets can be made with 16 eggs:
- Each omelet requires 4 eggs.
- Therefore, the number of omelets is \(16 \text{ eggs} \div 4 \text{ eggs/omelet} = 4 \text{ omelets}\).

Now, we find out how many omelets each person gets:
- There are 4 people in total.
- With 4 omelets, each person gets \(\frac{4 \text{ omelets}}{4 \text{ people}} = 1 \text{ omelet}\).

Thus, each person gets \(\boxed{1}\) omelet.

Nicky is trading baseball cards with Jill. If Nicky trades two cards worth $8 each for 1 card worth $21, how many dollars of profit does he make? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine the profit Nicky makes from his trade, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of the cards traded:**
   - Each card Nicky trades is worth $8.
   - Nicky trades 2 cards.
   - Total value of the cards traded = \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the value of the card Nicky receives in return:**
   - The other player (Jill) receives one card worth $21.
   - Value of the card received = $21.

3. **Find the net profit by subtracting the cost of the traded cards from the value received:**
   - Cost of the traded cards = 2 × $8 = $16.
   - Net profit = Value received - Cost of traded cards
   - Net profit = $21 - $16 = $5.

Thus, the profit that Nicky makes from this trade is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars.

The number of short students in a class is 2/5 of the total number of students. If there are 90 tall students, and the class has 400 students, calculate the total number of students with average height. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To find the total number of students with an average height, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of short students.
2. Use the given information about the number of tall students and the total number of students to find the number of students with average height.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of short students.**

We know that the number of short students is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of students. The total number of students is 400.

\[
\text{Number of short students} = \frac{2}{5} \times 400 = \frac{800}{5} = 160
\]

So, there are 160 short students.

**Step 2: Find the number of students with average height.**

Since the total number of students is 400 and the number of short students is 160, the number of students with average height is:

\[
\text{Number of students with average height} = 400 - 160 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total number of students with an average height is \(\boxed{240}\).

Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many minutes Leo spent on the third part of his assignment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it took Leo to complete the second part of his assignment.
2. Add the time for the first and second parts to find the total time for completing both parts.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that the first part of the assignment took 25 minutes. The second part took twice as long as the first part. Therefore, the time for the second part is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the time for the first and second parts to find the total time for completing both parts:
\[ 25 + 50 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Leo completed his entire assignment in 2 hours, we convert 2 hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total time spent on the first two parts from the total time to find the time spent on the third part:
\[ 120 - 75 = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Leo spent on the third part of the assignment is:

Padma is trading cards with Robert. Padma started with 75 cards and traded 2 or her valuable ones for 10 of Robert's cards. Robert started with 88 of his own cards and traded another 8 of his cards for 15 of Padma's cards. How many cards were traded between both Padma and Robert? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many cards were traded between Padma and Robert, we need to analyze their exchanges step by step.

First, let's establish the initial number of cards each person had:
- Padma initially had 75 cards.
- Robert initially had 88 cards.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Transaction involving Padma:**
   - Padma traded 2 cards for 10 of Robert's cards.
   - This means that if Padma gave away 2 cards (let's call this amount \( x \)), she gained 10 cards (which are equivalent to Robert's cards).

2. **Determine how many cards Padma has after the trade:**
   - Initial number of cards Padma had: 75
   - Number of cards she gained: 10

   So, the total number of cards Padma ends up with:
   \[
   75 + 10 = 85
   \]

3. **Transaction involving Robert:**
   - Robert traded 8 cards for 15 of Padma's cards.
   - This means that if Robert received 8 cards (let’s call this amount \( y \)), he lost 15 cards (which are equivalent to Padma's cards).

4. **Determine how many cards Robert has after the trade:**
   - Initial number of cards Robert had: 88
   - Number of cards he lost: 15

   So, the total number of cards Robert ends up with:
   \[
   88 - 15 = 73
   \]

5. **Calculate the net change in the number of cards traded:**
   - The difference in the number of cards traded between Padma and Robert is:
     \[
     10 - (-15) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of cards traded between Padma and Robert is:
     \[
     10 + 25 = 35
     \]

So, the final answer is:
\boxed{35}

James gets bored with his game so decides to play a different one.  That game promises 100 hours of gameplay but 80% of that is boring grinding.  However, the expansion does add another 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay.  How much enjoyable gameplay does James get? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how much enjoyable gameplay James gets from the new game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of enjoyable gameplay from the original game.
2. Add the additional enjoyable gameplay provided by the expansion.

**Step 1: Calculate the enjoyable gameplay from the original game.**

The original game promises 100 hours of gameplay, and 80% of this time is considered grinding. We can calculate the enjoyable gameplay as follows:
\[
100 \text{ hours} \times (1 - 0.8) = 100 \text{ hours} \times 0.2 = 20 \text{ hours}
\]

So, 20 hours of enjoyable gameplay come from the original game.

**Step 2: Add the enjoyable gameplay from the expansion.**

The expansion adds an additional 30 hours of enjoyable gameplay. Adding this to the enjoyable gameplay from the original game gives us:
\[
20 \text{ hours} + 30 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of enjoyable gameplay James gets is:
\[
\boxed{50}

Jane is trying to decide whether to buy a house or a trailer. A house costs $480,000 and a trailer costs $120,000. Each loan will be paid in monthly installments over 20 years. How much more is the monthly payment on the house compared to the trailer? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To find out how much more Jane needs to pay per month for the house compared to the trailer, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of each loan:**
   - House: \( \$480,000 \)
   - Trailer: \( \$120,000 \)

2. **Determine the number of payments:**
   - Both loans are paid over 20 years.
   - There are 12 months in 20 years.

3. **Find the monthly payment for each loan:**
   - For the house:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Payments}} = \frac{480,000}{12} = 40,000
     \]

   - For the trailer:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Payments}} = \frac{120,000}{12} = 10,000
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference in monthly payments:**
   - Difference:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{House Monthly Payment} - \text{Trailer Monthly Payment} = 40,000 - 10,000 = 30,000
     \]

Therefore, the monthly payment for the house is \( \$30,000 \) more than the monthly payment for the trailer. The final answer is \(\boxed{30000}\).

To determine how many pencils Eric can evenly distribute between the five containers after receiving additional pencils, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pencils after receiving the additional pencils.
2. Divide the new total number of pencils by the number of containers to find out how many pencils can be distributed evenly.

First, we know that before class, Eric had 150 pencils. After receiving 30 more pencils from a different teacher, the total number of pencils becomes:
\[ 150 + 30 = 180 \]

Next, we need to divide this total number of pencils by the number of containers (which is still 5) to find out how many pencils can be evenly distributed:
\[ 180 \div 5 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils that can be evenly distributed between the five containers is \(\boxed{36}\).

How many days does it take the sprinkler system to use 50 liters of water? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many days it takes for the sprinkler system to use 50 liters of water, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per day.
2. Determine how many days are required to use exactly 50 liters of water.

First, let's find out how much water is used each time the sprinkler system runs:
- Water used in the morning: 4 liters
- Water used in the evening: 6 liters

So, the total water used per day is:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many days are required to use 50 liters of water at this rate. We do this by dividing the total amount of water needed by the amount of water used per day:

If his second job pays $9 per hour then how much money, in dollars, did Mike receive from his first job? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how much money Mike received from his first job, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total earnings**: The total amount of money Mike earned is $160.

2. **Determine the hourly wage from his second job**: 
   - His second job pays him $9 per hour.
   - He worked 12 hours a week at this rate.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from his second job**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second job} = 9 \, \text{\$/hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours} = 108 \, \text{\$}
   \]

4. **Subtract the earnings from the second job from the total earnings**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from first job} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Earnings from second job}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from first job} = 160 \, \text{\$} - 108 \, \text{\$} = 52 \, \text{\$}

To determine how many more minutes Kwame and Connor studied than Lexia, we need to convert all study times to the same unit of time (minutes) and then find the difference.

First, let's convert Kwame's study time from hours to minutes:
\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's convert Connor's study time from hours to minutes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's convert Lexia's study time from minutes to minutes:
\[ 97 \text{ minutes} = 97 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we subtract Lexia's study time from Kwame's and Connor's studies:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} - 90 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} - 97 \text{ minutes} = -7 \text{ minutes} \]

The net difference in study time is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - (-7 \text{ minutes}) = 60 \text{ minutes} + 7 \text{ minutes} = 67 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Kwame and Connor studied 67 minutes more than Lexia. The final answer is:

Juan needs 10 half-gallons of milk to bake 40 cookies with. How many half-gallons of milk does Juan need to bake 200 dozen cookies? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how much milk Juan needs for baking 200 dozen cookies, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of milk needed per cookie:**
   - We know that Juan needs 10 half-gallons (lh) of milk to bake 40 cookies.
   - Therefore, the amount of milk needed per cookie is:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ lh}}{40 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{10}{40} \text{ lh/cookie} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ lh/cookie}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of milk needed for 200 dozen cookies:**
   - There are 12 cookies in a dozen.
   - Therefore, 200 dozen cookies equate to:
     \[
     200 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ cookies/dozen} = 2400 \text{ cookies}
     \]
   - Using the rate of milk needed per cookie, the total amount of milk needed is:
     \[
     2400 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1 \text{ lh}}{4 \text{ lh/cookie}} = 600 \text{ lh}
     \]

3. **Convert the total amount of milk from liters to half-gallons:**
   - Since there are 7000 milliliters in a liter, 600 liters is equivalent to:
     \[
     600 \text{ liters} \times \frac{7000 \text{ mL/liter}}{1000 \text{ ml/liter}} = 60 \text{ half-gallons}
     \]

Therefore, the number of half-gallons of milk Juan needs to bake 200 dozen cookies is \(\boxed{60}\).

Jane, Kyla, and Anthony have summer jobs in a resort. Their task is to fold guests' towels. Jane can fold 3 towels in 5 minutes. Kyla can fold 5 towels in 10 minutes, and Anthony can fold 7 towels in 20 minutes. If they all fold towels together, how many towels can they fold in one hour? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine how many towels Jane, Kyla, and Anthony can fold in one hour when working together, we first need to calculate their individual folding rates and then combine them.

1. **Calculate Jane's folding rate:**
   Jane folds 3 towels in 5 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Jane's rate} = \frac{3 \text{ towels}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ towels per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculate Kyla's folding rate:**
   Kyla folds 5 towels in 10 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Kyla's rate} = \frac{5 \text{ towels}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ towels per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate Anthony's folding rate:**
   Anthony folds 7 towels in 20 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Anthony's rate} = \frac{7 \text{ towels}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{7}{20} \text{ towels per minute}
   \]

4. **Combine their rates:**
   To find their combined rate when working together, we add their individual rates:
   \[
   \text{Combined rate} = \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{7}{20}
   \]
   
   First, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 5, 2, and 20 is 20.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{12}{20}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10}{2 \times 10} = \frac{10}{20}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{7}{20} = \frac{7}{20}
   \]

   Now, add the fractions:
   \[
   \text{Combined rate} = \frac{12}{20} + \frac{10}{20} + \frac{7}{20} = \frac{12 + 10 + 7}{20} = \frac{29}{20} \text{ towels per minute}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time from hours to minutes:**
   There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 1 hour:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of towels folded in 1 hour:**
   Multiply the combined rate by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Total towels} = \left( \frac{29}{20} \text{ towels per minute} \right) \times 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Total towels} = \frac{29 \times 60}{20} = \frac{1740}{20} = 87 \text{ towels}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of towels that Jane, Kyla, and Anthony can fold in one hour is \boxed{87}.

\[ 170 \text{ sticks} - 150 \text{ sticks} = 20 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the number of popsicle sticks Miss Davis has left is \(\boxed{20}\).

Alicia has to buy some books for the new school year. She buys 2 math books, 3 art books, and 6 science books, for a total of $30. If both the math and science books cost $3 each, what was the cost of each art book? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine the cost of each art book, we start by defining the variables and setting up equations based on the information provided.

First, let's define:
- \( M \) as the cost of one math book.
- \( A \) as the cost of one art book.
- \( S \) as the cost of one science book.

From the problem, we know that Alicia bought:
- 2 math books: \( 2M \).
- 3 art books: \( 3A \).
- 6 science books: \( 6S \).

The total cost of all these books is $30. Additionally, both the math and science books cost $3 each. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:

\[
2M + 3A + 6S = 30
\]

We also know that both the math and science books cost $3 each, so we can express the costs in terms of their individual prices:

\[
2M = 3S \quad \text{and} \quad 3A = 3S
\]

Since both expressions are equal to \( 3S \), we can simplify our equation by dividing through by 3:

\[
2M + 3A = 30
\]

Now we have two simplified equations:
1. \( 2M + 3A = 30 \)
2. \( 2M = 3S \)

To find the value of \( S \), we solve for \( S \):

\[
2M = 3S \implies S = \frac{2M}{3}
\]

Next, substitute \( S = \frac{2M}{3} \) into the first equation \( 2M + 3A = 30 \):

\[
2M + 3A = 30
\]

Substitute \( S = \frac{2M}{3} \):

\[
2M + 3A = 30 \implies 3A = 30 - 2M
\]

Solve for \( A \):

\[
3A = 30 - 2M \implies A = \frac{30 - 2M}{3}
\]

Thus, the cost of each art book is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{30 - 2M}{3}}
\]

Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day.  On the days he plays video games he plays for half as long as he watches TV.  If he plays video games 3 days a week how long does he spend watching TV and playing video games? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total time spent on TV per day:**
   Mike watches TV for 4 hours every day.

2. **Calculate the total time spent on TV over the entire week:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily TV time by 7:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Determine the total time spent on video game sessions per day:**
   On days Mike plays video games, he spends half as long as he watches TV.
   
   Therefore, the time spent on video game sessions is:
   \[
   \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent on video game sessions over the entire week:**
   Again, multiplying the weekly TV time by 7:
   \[
   28 \text{ hours/week} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 196 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

5. **Sum up all the times to find the total weekly expenditure:**
   Add the weekly TV time (28 hours) and the weekly video game session time (196 hours):
   \[
   28 \text{ hours/week} + 196 \text{ hours/week} = 224 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Thus, the total time Mike spends watching TV and playing video games each week is \( \boxed{224} \) hours.

Harrison Elementary School is overcrowded with 1590 students, so 40% of the students are going to move to a new school. There are 3 grade levels, and each grade level needs one 20-person advanced class and the rest of the students divided evenly into 6 additional classes. How many students will there be in each normal class at the new school? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.


To determine the number of students per normal class at the new school, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students moving:**
   Harrison Elementary School has 1590 students, and 40% of them will move.
   \[
   \text{Number of students moving} = 1590 \times 0.40 = 636
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students needed for the advanced class:**
   Each grade level requires one 20-person advanced class.

3. **Find out how many students remain after accounting for the advanced class:**
   Subtract the number of students moving from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1590 - 636 = 954
   \]

4. **Divide the remaining students equally among the other grade levels:**
   There are three grade levels, and each will receive an equal share of the remaining students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per class} = \frac{954}{3}
   \]
   
   Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{954}{3} = 318
   \]

Thus, the number of students per normal class at the new school is \(\boxed{318}\).

To find out how many hours Nathan and Tobias played in total, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Nathan played.
2. Calculate the total number of hours Tobias played.
3. Add the total hours played by Nathan and Tobias together.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Nathan played.**

Nathan plays for 3 hours each day for 7 days. So, the total number of hours Nathan played is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Tobias played.**

Tobias plays for 5 hours each day for 7 days. So, the total number of hours Tobias played is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Add the total hours played by Nathan and Tobias together.**

The total number of hours played by both Nathan and Tobias is:
\[ 21 \text{ hours} + 35 \text{ hours} = 56 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Nathan and Tobias played together is \(\boxed{56}\).
